# Current and Target State Architecture

This section focuses on whether the project is aligned with EA published target architecture and roadmaps. Please make sure you align with your cluster EA on current and target architecture of the project scope. Provide a current and target architecture high level diagrams from TarDev document and explain how this project is aligned with the target architecture.

Note: If the SDD scope is to upgrade/modify an existing system, conducting a POC, the requirement above can be ignored. This section is targeted for larger projects/initiatives where we are introducing new capabilities or changing technology direction.
Define the current state of the business process and systems. Provide diagrams for the same. If there is a manual process that fulfils the requirements, please elaborate on the process at a high level.

The next section (Section#4) focuses on the details of the build components, security, technology stack and application integrations as part of the solution design for the scope of the project.
