## RACE Process Control Statements

Once the PRE-CART has been completed for your application, the process will generate control statements based on your application's CIA rating. Please download and provide a link to them under the reference section. Otherwise, indicate why the assessment is not available at the time of your submission (i.e., you are submitting an SDD for a POC or for a project that has been through the legacy Compliance Gate Process).
