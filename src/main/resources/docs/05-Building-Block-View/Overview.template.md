**Content**

The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system
into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers,
functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their
dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation. In analogy
to a house this is the *floor plan*.

**Motivation**

Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure
understandable through abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract
level without disclosing implementation details.

**Form**

The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and
white boxes (see figure below) and their descriptions.
