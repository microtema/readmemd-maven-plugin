**Contents**

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions
including rationales. With \"decisions\" we mean selecting one
alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision
should be documented here in this central section or whether you better
document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building
block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to other sections, where you already captured the
most important decisions of your architecture.

**Motivation**

Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace
your decisions.
