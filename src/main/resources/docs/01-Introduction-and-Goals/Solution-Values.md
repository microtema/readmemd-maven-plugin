Values for Business and IT:

* Global deployment in a coherent way

  This will be of value for the business as well as for the IT product owners using the service internally. We will have the same interface and processes around the globe. This would harmonize processes like downstream enablement or onboarding as well as operations.

* Easier deployment and consistency by containerization

  Having the possibility of rolling out software; even multiple versions in parallel (as long as the interfaces and configurations are similar) allows an easier deployment with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

* Modernization of existing platform and becoming future-proof

  The scope is restricted to SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) for the MVP. The environment will include multiple other ways of data intake like streaming via HTTPS. Which makes this a global future proof deployment.

* Fulfilling modern security requirements

  There are some older environments for data intake within the MunichRE landscape. These are not fully up-to-date from a security perspective. Therefore we will fulfill the needed security requirements with the new Global Managed File Transfer.

* Scalability and speed

  With the new approach a more scalable and centrally managed environment will be available. This leads to shorter lead times.
